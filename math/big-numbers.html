<h1> Writing an arbitrarily large number </h1>


The Indian number system works using the positional value. The same digit can 
have a different value when it is in a different position. For example,

<blockquote>
 The value of digit 1 in number 111 is different depending on the position. 
</blockquote>


<table>

  <tr> 

    <td> Place value &rarr;</td>
    <td> 100</td>
    <td> 10 </td>
    <td> 1 </td>
    <td> &nbsp; </td>
    <td> $frac{1}{10}$</td>
    <td> $frac{1}{100}$</td>
    <td> $frac{1}{100}$</td>

  </tr>
  <tr> 

    <td> Digit &rarr; </td>
    <td>  1</td>
    <td>  1 </td>
    <td>  1 </td>
    <td> &nbsp; </td>
    <td> &nbsp;</td>
    <td> &nbsp;</td>
    <td> &nbsp;</td>


  </tr>
</table>

  

<p> 
  Here, the value of digit 1 is 1, 10 and 100 in the same number depending on 
  the position. This is an incredible powerful concept as it allows you to 
  write any arbitrarily large number with just a few symbols. Like in a Base-10 
  system, we can write any number by repeating just 10 symbols, namely,
  <blockquote>
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. 

  </blockquote>

</p>


<h1> What is Base-10 system? </h1>
The value of a digit in the 10-base is the positional value multiplied by the 
digit. If the positional value is increasing powers of 10 then the number system 
is called Base-10. 10 raised to a power is multiplying 10 so many times. 

like, $10^N$ is 1 followed by N zeros. 

For example, 

<ul>
  <li> $10^0$ is 1 </li> 
  <li> $10^1$ is 10 </li> 
  <li> $10^2$ is 10 $times$ 10 = 100, 1 followed by 2 zeros </li> 
  <li> $10^3$ is 10 $times$ 10 $times$ 10 = 1000, 1 followed by 3 zeros</li> 
  <li> $10^4$ is 10 $times$ 10 $times$ 10 $times$ 10 = 10000, 1 followed by 4 zeros</li> 

</ul>

So we can also think of position values as,


<table>

  <tr> 
    <td> Position &rarr;</td>
    <td> 5</td>
    <td> 4 </td>
    <td> 3 </td>
    <td> 2 </td>
    <td> 1 </td>
    <td> 0 </td>

  </tr>
  <tr> 

    <td> Power of 10 &rarr; </td>
    <td> $10^5$ </td>
    <td> $10^4$  </td>
    <td> $10^3$ </td>
    <td> $10^2$ </td>
    <td> $10^1$ </td>
    <td> $10^0$ </td>

  </tr>

  <tr> 
    <td> Place value &rarr;</td>
    <td> 100000</td>
    <td> 10000 </td>
    <td> 1000</td>
    <td> 100</td>
    <td> 10</td>
    <td> 1</td>

  </tr>

</table>

so we are calculating positional value of a digit in the number using powers of 
10. There is nothing magical about using powers of 10. We may as well use 
powers of 8 (octal) or powers of 16 (hexadecimal systems). The choice of 10 is 
largely related to humans having 10 digits or 10 fingers! 




<h1> Comparing big numbers </h1>

A number having the higher value is bigger. The value of a number is the sum of 
all positional values of its digits.

<p> 
3245 is less than 123456 because 123456 is the order of $10^5$ and 
3245 is of order of $10^3$. When the numbers are of the same order, look at 
the digits in the highest position. Hence 4000 is greater than 3999.  When 
digits in the highest position are the same then look at next highest position 
and so on. <br> <br>

Like, 1200 and 1199 both are of the order of $10^3$ and both have 1 in the 
$10^3$ position. However 1200 has 2 in the next position ( of $10^2$) and hence 
it is bigger than 1199.

<h2> How we do sum of powers of 10 </h2>

$10^5$ is 1 followed by 5 zeros. That can also be written as 1 followed by 2 zeros 
followed by three more zeros. <br>
$10^5$ = $10^2$ $times$ $10^3$ <br>
Or, 1 followed by 5 zeros is 1 followed by 1 zero and then followed by 4 zeros. <br>
$10^5$ = $10^1$ $times$ $10^4$ <br>

Same way, we can write $10^7$ as, <br>
$10^7$ = $10^2$ $times$ $10^5$ <br>
OR $10^7$ = $10^1$ $times$ $10^6$ <br>
OR $10^7$ = $10^4$ $times$ $10^3$ <br>


<h2> Conversions </h2>
<ul>
  <li> 1 Crore = $10^7$ </li>
  <li> 1 Lakh = $10^5$ </li>
  <li> 1 Million = $10^6$ </li>
  <li> 1 Billion = $10^9$ </li>
</ul>


<blockquote>
Question: Convert 5 Crores into Millions 
</blockquote>


5 Crore = 5 $times$ $10^7$ = 5,00,00,000 (7 zeros) <br> 
1 Million = 1,000, 000 so divide by 1,000,000 to get millions<br>
= $frac{5,00,00,000}{1,000,000}$ = 50 Millions <br>



<blockquote>
  Question: Convert 70 Millions into Lakhs
</blockquote>
  
70 Millions = 70 $times$ $10^6$ = 70 ,000,000 <br>
1 Lakh = 1,00,000 <br>
So to convert to Lakhs, divide by 1,00,000 <br>
= $frac{70, 000, 000}{1,00,000}$ = 700 Lakhs <br>


  
<blockquote>
  Question: Convert 5 Billions into Crores
</blockquote>
  
5 Billions = 5 $times$ $10^9$ = 5 $times$ $10^2$ $times$ $10^7$ = 500 Crore 


<h1> Estimations </h1>


<h1> Properties of Numbers </h1>


<h2> Set of Numbers </h2>

Remember - Natural numbers are the numbers that you can count on fingers, 
Like 1, 2, 3 , 4 .... etc. When we add zero to the set of natural numbers, 
we get the set of Whole numbers. Suppose the red below represents the set of 
whole numbers.<br> 


The fractions, like $frac{1} {2}$  or $frac{3} {4}$ are outside the set of 
whole numbers. If we want to include the fractions also then we have to include 
both red and yellow.  <br> <br>


<div> 
  <svg viewBox="0 0 10 10" width="30%">
    <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="4" fill="yellow" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="blue" fill="#fff"/>
    <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="2" fill="red"/>
  </svg>
</div> 

Suppose, we want decimals also. The set of decimals will be bigger than the set 
of fractions. All decimals are not fractions. So to represent the set of decimals, 
we have to include whole numbers, fractions and decimals. We show that by blue.
The set of decimals have red, yellow as well as blue. 


<h2> Closure   </h2>

If We take two whole numbers and perform an operation on them then we get 
a third whole number. Some examples are 

<table>

  <tr> 
    <th> 1st Number </th>
    <th>  2nd Number </th>
    <th> Operation </th>
    <th> Result  </th>
    <th> CLOSE?  </th>
  </tr>

  <tr> 
    <td> 2 </td>
    <td> 3 </td>
    <td> + </td>
    <td> 5</td>
    <td> YES</td>
  </tr>


  <tr> 
    <td> 2 </td>
    <td> 3 </td>
    <td> - </td>
    <td> -1 </td>
    <td> NO</td>
  </tr>

  <tr> 
    <td> 2 </td>
    <td> 3 </td>
    <td> $times$ </td>
    <td> 6 </td>
    <td> YES</td>
  </tr>

  <tr> 
    <td> 2 </td>
    <td> 3 </td>
    <td> $div$ </td>
    <td> $frac{2}{3}$</td>
    <td> NO</td>
  </tr>

</table>


If the result of the operation is also a whole number then the set of whole 
numbers is closed under that operation and this property is called closure. 
From the above table, we can see that Addition and Multiplication have 
closure over whole numbers. 


<h2> Commutative Law   </h2>

When we add two or more whole numbers, the order of numbers do not matter for 
the sum. Suppose, we want to add up 5, 8 and 7. It does not matter in what order 
we write the sums, the result would be the same. 

<ul>
  <li> 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 </li>
  <li> 5 + 8 + 7 = 20 </li>
  <li> 8 + 7 + 5 = 20 </li>
  <li> 8 + 5 + 7 = 20 </li>
  <li> ....... </li>
</ul>

The same thing is applicable for multiplcation of whole numbers as well,

<ul>
  <li>3 x 4 x 5 = 60 </li>
  <li>3 x 5 x 4 = 60 </li>
  <li>5 x 4 x 3 = 60 </li>
  <li>5 x 3 x 4 = 60 </li>
  <li> ....... </li>
</ul>


<h2> Associative Law   </h2>

Terms of factors of whole numbers can be associated in any way desired. 

<ul> 

  <li> 2 + (3+ 5) = (2+3) + 5</li>
  <li> 77 + (2+ 3) = (77+2) + 3</li>
</ul>

The terms in the parantheses (brackets) should be evaluated first and then 
plugged into the equation, e.g. <br>

2 + (3 + 5) is 2 + (8) = 10 <br>
(2 + 3) + 5 is (5) + 5 = 10 <br>

The same applies for multiplication,

<ul> 

  <li> 2 x (3 x5) = 2 x (15)  = 30 </li>
  <li> (2 x 3) x5 = (6) x 5  = 30 </li>
  
</ul>

How we make groups of terms using brackets do not matter for sum and multiplcation 
of whole numbers. 


<h2> Distributive Property of Multiplication   </h2>

<h3> 4 $times$ 7 is same as 4 $times$ (5 + 2) </h3>

<p> 
If we are given, 4 $times$ (5 + 2) then we can first do (5+2) = 7 and then 
multiply 4 by 7 to get the answer, i.e. 4 $times$ 7 = 28. However, we can also 
this by multiplying 4 $times$ 5 and 4 $times$ 2 and then add them together.  
<p>
<p> 
This is incredibly useful property for doing bigger multiplications. like, 28 $times$ 110 
can be written as 28 $times$ (100 + 10) and then we can multiply 28 $times$ 100 and 
28 $times$ 10 and add them up. The result is 2800 + 280 = 3080 and it is much easier 
to do than the original multiplication. The multiplication can be distributed over 
the plus operation. 
</p> 


<p> 

  117 $times$ 13 = (100 + 17) $times$ (10 + 3) <br>
  = (100 $times$ 10) + (100 $times$ 3) + (17 $times$ 10) + (17 $times$ 3) <br> 
  = 1000 + 300 + 170 + 52 <br>
  = 1470 + 52 <br>
  = 1522 <br>
